# Data preparation notebook for Rasa diagnosis bot tutorial

This repository contains a jupyter notebook outlining the preliminary data prep done for [my blog post](https://paulminogue.com/index.php/2020/04/26/using-the-rasa-framework-to-implement-a-simple-medical-diagnosis-bot/) on creating a medical diagnosis bot using rasa.

Part 1 describes how to prepare the input data for the diagnosis portion of the project while part 2 describes how I generated some training data for Rasa's NLU model.

I have separated these from the tutorial source code repository as I thought a notebook was the best way to present
the data preparation steps and I did not want to include any jupyter notebooks in the main repository to avoid any confusion.

The used in this was aquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/plarmuseau/sdsort/home)
